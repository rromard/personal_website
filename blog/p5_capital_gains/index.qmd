Canada's tax system is notoriously unfair. At every twist and turn, it is set up to favour those who make their income just by owning property, rather than those who must work for wages. One of the most stunning examples of this bias toward property income is the capital gains exemption loophole.

Capital gains are profits made by selling assets that have increased in value. If one buys company shares worth \$10,000 and sells them down the road for \$20,000, that's a capital gain of \$10,000. Most people own little to no capital assets and so enjoy significant capital gains only very rarely – it is mostly the territory of the wealthy and corporations, who buy and sell assets for gain with regularity.

Since 2003, only 50% of income made by capital gains has been subjected to taxes – that is to say that half of capital gains were entirely tax free. Income paid to labour or some transfers like EI payments are always entirely subject to income taxes. Yet, if you are a landlord, and just sold your third investment property for a hefty return – half of that income would be totally tax free.

Tax justice advocates have long called for closing this capital gains tax loophole, which is set up to massively benefit wealthy property owners and corporations. Canada's Liberal government, under pressure to pursue *some* kind of tax reform, both to comply with OECD-wide tax changes and to fund their own spending agenda, announced intent to raise the rate of inclusion on capital gains over \$250,000 from 50 to 66% early in 2024. This amounts to a very small effective increase in capital gains tax rates, which are still extremely generous.

Under the new tax plan, the 50% inclusion rate still applies to gains of under a quarter million dollars, while the new rate of two-thirds applies on gains over that threshold. In other words, a very large portion of that income is still completely tax free. Since the threshold for the new tax rate is so high, only a very small number of high income individuals would be impacted. Businesses would have their gains taxed entirely at the higher rate, but it was coupled with some rather generous tax benefits to small and medium sized businesses to offset much of the impact.

## Header on the moment

Despite the [collective meltdown](https://www.cbc.ca/news/business/canadian-entrepreneurs-investors-capital-gains-tax-reaction-1.7176837) by Canada's [capitalist class](https://financialpost.com/fp-finance/banking/national-bank-ceo-slams-canadas-capital-gains-tax-increase-2) and it's various representatives throughout society over the very minor tax increase, the reform looked like it was a done deal in the summer of 2024. In a baffling turn of events, the ailing Liberals pulled the capital gains tax reform out into a [separate bill](https://www.advisor.ca/economy/policy/capital-gains-tax-changes-not-included-in-freelands-motion-to-introduce-budget-bill/), instead of passing it with the budget as tax measures usually are.

Less than a year later, they extinguished their own bill when they pulled to plug on parliament in a desperate move to stave off the inevitable end. Snatching defeat from the jaws of victory, Trudeau and company made an unforced error, fumbling the ball at the goal line.

It is one of the [main themes](https://www.policyalternatives.ca/news-research/promise-and-performance-what-justin-trudeau-leaves-behind/) of the Trudeau government, which had to be arm-twisted into cynically and halfheartedly pursuing modest reforms and new (*always means-tested, of course!*) social programs: **another missed opportunity to produce meaningful change**.

In this case, it is a squandered chance to introduce meaningful tax reform into a [country with a tax system so regressive](https://www.policyalternatives.ca/news-research/canadas-shift-to-a-more-regressive-tax-system-2004-to-2022/), it should be an ongoing national scandal. They missed the moment not only because they scored an own-goal at the very last second, but because their proposals – focus-group tested "progressive" on one hand and austerity-hawk neoliberal on the other – were far [too modest and limited in vision](https://canadiandimension.com/articles/view/budget-2024-is-a-small-step-toward-a-grown-up-economy) to begin with.

The new rate of two-thirds falls far short of even Canada's historical high, when in the 1990s three-quarters (75%) of capital gains were included in taxable income. To fix Canada's regressive tax system, it is essential that income on capital and property is treated like income on labour, meaning all of it is subject to taxation.

Now, the fate of the small step forward to tax justice looks grim. There is an all out regressive taxation propaganda blitz to [ensure](https://financialpost.com/personal-finance/kim-moody-cra-messing-up-proposed-capital-gains-tax-rules) that the changes are [buried by the next government](https://www.cbc.ca/news/politics/capital-gains-conservatives-1.7430447). We will hear even more about how unfair these changes really are. About how very modest efforts to raise taxes on high incomes and corporate profits are causing Canada's economic problems. How [innovation](https://financialpost.com/news/canadian-tech-capital-gains-policy-industry-cci) and [productivity](https://financialpost.com/news/economy/capital-gains-tax-hike-blow-to-productivity-economists) will be crushed.

Now the Liberals are turning against their own tax reform in a futile attempt to bail water from a sinking ship. Former finance minister Chrystia Freeland, entirely unable to defend her own signature tax policy, has now [promised to scrap it](https://www.cbc.ca/news/politics/freeland-scrap-capital-gains-tax-changes-1.7439016) if elected. Former central banker and notable man of the people, Mark Carney, has done the same.

It will go much further than killing the capital gains tax reform, as a foot in the door making way for [an even more regressive tax system](https://financialpost.com/personal-finance/taxes/better-tax-treatment-capital-gains-improve-canada-economy-productivity), making Canada an vastly more unequal society than it already is.

Data from two dozen European countries shows that, at least in mature industrial economies, having higher capital gains tax rates, which are likely indicative of higher rates of capital income tax in general, is linked to higher labour productivity, lower inequality, and higher spending priority on essential social services like health and education.

## Data: Capital gains tax rates in Europe from 2011-2023

In general, international data or statistics on capital gains tax rates (CGT rate) are not easy to come by. This analysis relies on data published by the Tax Foundation on the top capital gains tax rates for individuals in over twenty European countries.

Note, up until now we have been talking about the capital gains inclusion rate in Canada, how much is counted as taxable income, while this data deals with the actual top tax rates on capital gains in each country. With this data, we are comparing the actual top tax rates paid on capital gains by individuals, regardless of how that country taxes capital gains.

There are two periods covered, one from 2011-2014 and one from 2019-2023. I'm not aware of another data source to fill those years in, other than meticulous manual gathering from public records, which isn't on the table right now.

Putting this dataset together requires some simplification for the purposes of comparison, since the way capital gains are treated can vary greatly across tax systems. Hover over countries marked by an asterisk to see notes on the data provided by the Tax Foundation.

This data set was combined with macro level economic data from the World Inequality Database and the OECD's Productivity Statistics Database for comparison against capital gains tax rates.

## Capital gains tax rates not strongly linked to growth

A striking episode of [evidence free tax fear-mongering on behalf of capital](https://www.cdhowe.org/publication/do-not-resuscitate-increasing-the-capital-gains-tax-harms-us-all/) came from the C.D. Howe Institute, which issued a report predicting a very small increase in capital gains taxes will inflict billions in economic damage, costing hundreds of thousands of jobs.

Can a truly modest tax increase on capital bring about economic mass destruction according to so-called "financial theory?"

Well, what can we observe from data when countries actually change their capital gains tax rates in the real world? According to the Tax Foundation's data, 2011-2012 were banner years for capital gains tax reform and likely tax reform in general, as many European countries were pursuing *somewhat* [more progressive tax policies](https://docs.iza.org/dp15302.pdf) in response to the revenue fallout of the Great Recession just a few years prior.

Several countries, some of the largest economies in Europe at that, instituted a change in their top personal CGT rate from 2011 through to 2012. Below are the notable examples of countries that raised their CGT rate in 2012. That includes two that went from having no gains taxes to instituting a CGT rate of 25%, which is near the European average, Austria and Portugal. Italy went in the opposite direction, slashing it's CGT rate from 45 down to 20%, but it did little to benefit their moribund economy.

The table below compares average GDP growth in the decade prior (2001-2011) to the CGT rate change to the tax-year and the next five years (2012-2017). There is not a clear relationship between changes in the CGT rate and economic growth that applies across all countries. Some raised the CGT rate and then outpaced their historical growth trend, while others raised their rates and then slightly under-performed over the next few years.

It stands to reason that it is possible for changes in the CGT rate to have a macro level economic impact observable in growth rate changes. Yet as we can see plainly, even major changes in the CGT rate, including the shock of moving away from zero capital gains taxes, the impact on growth had to be minimal, with countries mostly staying in line with their long-term growth trajectories.

Now, I don't endorse using GDP or GDP growth as a measure of economic well-being, but in this context it yields zero evidence of the doom-and-gloom theorized by certain advocates of capital. Below, we look into the relationship between the CGT rate and some more meaningful variables of interest.

## Higher gains tax rates, higher productivity

Labour productivity, the measure of how much value is produced by an hour of labour or by each worker employed, is more directly related to well-being than GDP and GDP growth. It is no coincidence that countries with the highest standards of living in the world also tend to be the most productive – it is a necessary, but not a sufficient condition for prosperity.

More productive countries tend to tax capital gains at higher rates. In the past, I have written about how Canada's capital gains inclusion rate has [little bearing on productivity growth](https://www.taxfairness.ca/en/resources/reports/productivity-and-capital-gains-inclusion-rates). Yet, when looking at an international dataset of industrial economies, there is a clear association between the level of productivity achieved by an economy and the CGT rate.

The chart below compares the average top personal CGT rate on the horizontal axis to average labour productivity on the vertical axis, across each time period.[^1] There is a clear positive correlation between capital gains taxes and labour productivity, where more productive countries tend to tax capital gains at higher rates and vice versa.[^2]

[^1]: A note that for this scatter plot and the two that follow, countries with zero capital gains tax rates are not shown, this trend applies to countries that tax gains at all. There is a separate section comparing zero to non-zero rate countries that follows.

[^2]: Ireland has been excluded from the second chart panel due to concerns over the quality of their labour productivity data in that period.

Such a finding [concurs with research demonstrating](https://ideas.repec.org/a/kap/itaxpf/v26y2019i4d10.1007_s10797-019-09530-3.html) that as economies industrialize, mature and grow more productive, they also tend to tax capital income at higher rates.

### How are capital gains tax rates connected to labour productivity?

What is the connection between capital gains tax rates and productivity? We have heard ad nauseum about how even a [modest increase](https://financialpost.com/personal-finance/taxes/capital-gains-proposals-tax-economic-policy) in [capital gains taxes](https://cdhowe.org/publication/capital-gains-tax-hike-shortsighted-move-long-term-consequences-financial-post/) will [destroy productivity](https://www.reuters.com/world/americas/canadas-capital-gains-tax-rise-will-further-knock-productivity-say-economists-2024-04-18/) and crater Canada's economy.

If that is the case, why are the most productive countries also the ones that tax capital gains – and capital in general – at the highest rates?

#### Promoting proliferation of small businesses

Researchers at the Centre for Analysis of Taxation found that in the United Kingdom, found that overly generous CGT rates negatively impacted labour productivity by encouraging people to work in low-productivity, small and solo-proprietorship businesses in order to gain tax advantages:

> Currently capital gains are taxed at much lower rates than income. This encourages individuals to work in a form that allows them to be paid in capital gains, for example setting up a personal service company through which they get paid, and later extracting the income as capital gains by liquidating the company.
>
> A negative side effect of low CGT rates is the proliferation of these businesses, which not only reduce the overall tax take, but hamper productivity by having people working in ways that are less efficient but are individually optimal because of the tax saving. This contributes to the regularly diagnosed ‘long tail’ of unproductive firms in the UK. ([p. 2](https://centax.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/AdvaniHughsonInkleyLonsdaleSummers2024_ProductivityCostOfLowCapitalGainsTaxRates.pdf))

While the UK has had especially permissive laws and regulations on these forms of income-shifting, the tax incentive to shift labour income into capital income by solo or small business incorporation remains strong in Canada ([p. 22](https://researchers.allard.ubc.ca/ws/portalfiles/portal/40365785/Income%20Taxation%20of%20Small%20Business_%20Toward%20Simplicity%20Neutrality.pdf)), even though personal service corporations receive [less favourable tax treatment](https://www.burgesskilpatrick.com/beware-the-personal-services-business/) than in the UK.

Firm size and productivity are intuitively linked by economy of scale. Larger firms have a natural [productivity advantage over smaller firms](https://www.desjardins.com/content/dam/pdf/en/personal/savings-investment/economic-studies/canada-disruptive-innovation-sme-oct-16-2023.pdf) due to the efficiency increases of economies of scale – they can access much more capital, invest in more machinery and IP, hire more workers, and build larger facilities for them to work at. For that reason, the most productive industries tend to be the domain of large firms and vice versa.

It is widely recognized that workers in Canada are less productive on average than some peer countries, notably the U.S., due to our relative [over reliance on small enterprises](https://www.bankofcanada.ca/2024/03/time-to-break-the-glass-fixing-canadas-productivity-problem/).

Canada's tax system has an unusually generous treatment of capital gains, especially when [small and medium sized businesses are involved](https://financesofthenation.ca/2021/07/28/surplus-stripping-and-the-new-costly-tax-loophole-for-intergenerational-transfers/), which [one tax researcher describes](gateway%20for%20endless%20tax-minimizing%20and%20economy-distorting%20stratagems) as an "endless gateway to tax-minimizing and economy distorting stratagems." It is reasonable to hypothesize that the Canadian tax system's preference for capital gains could be contributing to this problem by encouraging the proliferation of small incorporated businesses.

#### Incentivizing productivity-killing financial speculation

When a business invests into producing goods and services for sale, we can consider that a productive activity that fulfills some social use. To profit in this way requires the exploitation of workers, but that is besides the point here, which is that these activities produce wealth in the form of real goods and services.

However, investors can find many ways to make a profit. Financial or speculative activities can be immensely profitable, but only involve assets being exchanged between parties, for example, stock or currency trading. When an asset is sold at a higher price than it was bought for, that is a capital gain – the profit is purely financial because nothing of value has been produced, only changed hands.

A lax and overly generous system of capital gains taxation therefore directly incentivizes zero-productivity speculative activity, which often stems from low-productivity sectors like construction. Research done by Canadians for Tax Fairness has shown that the 50% capital gains loophole has [helped blow up the housing bubble](https://www.taxfairness.ca/sites/default/files/2024-09/C4TF%20FIRE%20Report_0.pdf) and driven rents up by encouraging the financialization of housing with tremendous tax savings on the sale of investment properties.

Surely, the Canadian economy's reliance on a housing bubble has been worsened by the tax system's strong preference for capital gains – as investment properties are flipped after a few years of surging prices – which in turn has dragged on productivity.

In demographic terms, much of Canada's former manufacturing workforce, mostly men with high school or college level education, has shifted into [residential and commercial construction](https://fsc-ccf.ca/research/the-big-shift-changes-in-canadian-manufacturing-employment-2003-2018-executive-summary/).

Labour productivity levels has been [low and stagnant for over 40 years](https://storeys.com/canadian-construction-productivity-low/) in the construction sector for many reasons. One widely recognized reason for construction's productivity problem is the [highly fragmentary nature](https://www.cmhc-schl.gc.ca/blog/2024/what-canada-potential-capacity-housing-construction) of the sector, which is composed mostly of very small, low productivity firms that pay low wages.

#### Offsetting labour taxes and funding public investment

A higher capital gains tax regime could also impact productivity in positive ways. The first is that raising the share of tax revenue from capital presents an opportunity to lower the relative tax burden on labour, which can [negatively impact](https://public.econ.duke.edu/~peretto/FGP%20tax%20reform%202020.pdf) productivity.

Excessive taxation of labour income can reduce aggregate demand, which can harm productivity because it "reduces the market size for new innovations and has an adverse effect on domestic rates of innovation" ([p. 3](https://d-nb.info/1180470311/34)). By alleviating the tax burden on the working class majority of people, the general pool of money (and credit) available for (mostly) spending, but also saving and investing rises.

Capital gains taxation can have another positive impact on productivity, in that raising more revenue from capital affords an opportunity to raise government spending without adding to the tax burden on labour income ([p. 4](https://d-nb.info/1180470311/34)).

While much economic theory treats government spending and taxation as only an economic negative, it is crystal clear that spending in certain areas can potentially enhance labour productivity. In economic terms, this is described as the distinction between productive and unproductive government spending.

Research has found that by improving the health, well-being, and skill level of the workforce, state expenditures in areas such as such as [education](https://www.epi.org/publication/states-education-productivity-growth-foundations/), and [health care](http://old-eclass.uop.gr/modules/document/file.php/ES294/fiscal%20policy%202.pdf) can increase the amount of value produced by workers. Likewise, investments into [infrastructure](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s00181-018-1616-3#ref-CR1) and [public goods](https://sciencespo.hal.science/hal-03389155/file/2021-guillouzouic-henry-and-monras-local-public-goods-and-the-spatial-distribution-of-economic-activity.pdf) can also enhance labour productivity.

Another obvious productivity boosting avenue of spending would be government spending on research, development, innovation, and promoting the widespread adoption of new technologies. This is an area of public investment that [both levels](https://policyalternatives.ca/sites/default/files/uploads/publications/Ontario%20Office/2023/11/back-from-the-brink.pdf) of [Canadian governments](https://www.science.org/content/article/canada-scientists-are-struggling-stagnant-funding) have been [lagging behind](https://theconversation.com/two-decades-of-stagnant-funding-have-rendered-canada-uncompetitive-in-biomedical-research-heres-why-it-matters-and-how-to-fix-it-199370) for a long time.

## Higher gains tax rates, lower inequality

There is yet another pathway for capital gains taxation to impact labour productivity – [social and economic inequality](https://www.taxfairness.ca/en/resources/reports/productivity-and-capital-gains-inclusion-rates). Experts widely conclude that productivity and economic inequality are intrinsically linked in what is often called the [Inclusivity (or Inequality)-Productivity Nexus](https://www.oecd.org/en/publications/2018/09/the-productivity-inclusiveness-nexus_g1g8b3ba.html).

In general, workers in societies that are more equal grow more productive, while rising inequality can have a dampening effect on productivity growth. Researchers at the OECD found that the relationship is based on how inequality is both caused by and drives labour market outcomes at the bottom of the income distribution:

> The main link is via high income inequalities reducing investments in human capital, which in turn lead to diminished prospects for productivity growth. Hence ... a strong emphasis is put on the impact of poverty and inequality of opportunity on growth.

Below the chart displays the connection between income inequality – measured as the share of income captured by the top 10% – and the top personal capital gains tax rate for countries in the dataset. As expected, countries that are more equal in income terms have higher CGT rate than less equal countries and vice versa.

<br>

The connection between capital gains tax rates and economic inequality more intuitive than with productivity. Regressive tax systems are usually that way because they give very favourable treatment to capital income compared to labour income. Income from owning and selling property is vital to those on top of the class hierarchy, while the vast majority of people own no capital assets to sell in the first place and so seldom have significant capital gains ever.

Higher capital gains taxes could directly contribute to reducing inequality by taxing a preferred source of typically low-tax income for very wealthy people and large corporations, then using that to [invest in public services and public goods](https://www.nber.org/system/files/working_papers/w25126/w25126.pdf) that reduce inequality.

It is very likely that countries with higher CGT rates tax higher income at higher rates and are less permissive with high income tax filers – in other words, it is one marker for having a more progressive overall tax system.

## Higher gains tax rates, more priority on social spending

Taxes are a tool to raise revenue. How the funds that are raised with taxes are spent is also important to consider. There is a well-known connection between a government's ability to raise revenue (taxes as a share of GDP) and economic growth, with increased tax revenue supporting higher government social spending.

Research has established a connection between government tax revenue and both [healthcare](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC4513966/) and [education](https://unesdoc.unesco.org/ark:/48223/pf0000227092/PDF/227092eng.pdf.multi) spending. Mostly this has been studied in low and middle income countries in the context of development, but we can see something like this relationship on display in industrialized, European economies as well.

Capital gains tax rates were strongly related to government expenditures on health, education, and social protection (e.g. social security payments) relative to gross domestic product. Countries that had higher CGT rates – countries that tend to be both more equal and productive – also display a higher priority on social expenditures that support the health and wellness of the population.

Public spending in areas like [health](https://mrdrc.isr.umich.edu/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/wp441.pdf), [education](https://papers.tinbergen.nl/03024.pdf), and [social security or income support](https://wid.world/document/the-impact-of-social-security-wealth-on-the-distribution-of-wealth-in-the-european-union-world-inequality-lab-working-paper-2023-13/) have a well-known re-distributional effect, resulting in reduced income and wealth inequality. Countries with higher tax rates had more progressive tax systems overall, and were more likely to use the revenue raised pro-social ends – and not things like paying for extremely regressive tax breaks for the rich.

## A note on zero gains countries

There are a small number of countries in the sample that do not tax capital gains at all, including Belgium, the Czech Republic, Luxembourg, Slovakia, Slovenia, and Switzerland. In the scatter plots above, those countries have not been included because they stand apart from the general trend in terms of their zero tax rate.

It is likely more appropriate to compare those zero rate countries as a group to countries that do tax gains. Below, the table shows the average measures used above for countries with a zero rate of capital gains tax versus all other countries.

Among countries that didn't tax capital gains at all, there were two high productivity (Belgium and Switzerland), and two low productivity countries (Slovakia and Slovenia), and one with productivity data so cooked, it isn't worth considering (Luxembourg).

At first glance, the zero rate countries are vastly more productive, but this is mostly illusory, due to Luxembourg's vastly over-inflated productivity statistics bringing up the average.[^3] Account for that fact and productivity levels are equivalent in the 2011-2012 period, while zero rate countries end up slightly more productive, due to very strong growth by Belgium and Switzerland.

[^3]: due both to the fact that one-quarter of the workforce does not even live in the country, making the denominator (number of employed workers or number of hours worked) in productivity calculations seem smaller than it actually is, vastly inflating productivity statistics.

As we might expect from our findings so far, countries that do not tax capital gains saw a higher share of income going to the top 10% of income takers in the country compared to those that did tax capital gains. Likewise, the zero rate countries had a much smaller share of social spending in GDP, indicating a lower priority on government spending that reduces poverty and improves health and well-being.

## Header

In summary, looking across a dataset that covers 26 countries and and nine years, countries that taxed capital gains at a higher rate were (1) more productive, (2) more equal, and (3) had more robust social spending.

The table below shows the correlation values for each of the indicator variables used in this analysis and the capital gains tax rate in each year. Capital gains taxes had a strong positive correlations to productivity and the share of spending in health and social protection. There was a positive correlation with education spending, but it grows weaker as time progresses.

Conversely, capital gains tax rates had a strong negative correlation to various inequality measures – meaning as the CGT rate goes down, inequality goes up and vice versa. The negative correlation with the top 10% share of income was very strong throughout the time period. Capital gains tax rates were also strongly negatively correlated with the dispersion of income between the 90th and 10th income percentiles.

## Closing header

### Header

The capital gains tax exemption is one of the most regressive and expensive tax loopholes in Canada. It is in effect, a gift from the Canadian government – and the tax paying public by extension – to corporations and the wealthiest people in society.

In Canada, about one in ten people will report capital gains in a given year. In 2021, nearly half of those in the top 1% of income takers reported capital gains, rising to nearly three-quarters of people in the very top 0.01% of the income distribution. Even when average people do post capital gains, they usually aren't very high.

Tax filers in the top 1% of incomes had capital gains about 7.5 times higher than the bottom 99%, while those in the top 0.01% had gains over 57 times higher. For those at the top of the income ladder, average capital gains for those who had any were many times higher than average labour income for the vast majority of people.

As a result, capital gains are extremely concentrated in the hands of people with very high incomes and lots of concentrated wealth. According to economist Jim Stanford, the top 1.5% of tax filers booked 61% of all capital gains – he notes that there is no other form of income that is more concentrated at the top ([p. 9](https://centreforfuturework.ca/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/Capital-Gains-Chartbook.pdf)).

The capital gains exclusion loophole is almost entirely a tax-free treat for the rich and corporations – perhaps that explains the ferocity of the counter reaction to such a modest tax hike.

## Human need versus tax treats for the rich

Despite rising total government spending, Canada's vital public services and social programs face chronic under-funding from all levels of government. All across the country, [public](https://www.cbc.ca/news/politics/meet-the-canadians-without-a-family-doctor-1.7116475) [health](https://www.ctvnews.ca/health/article/your-trip-to-the-emergency-department-is-taking-longer-every-year-report/) [care](https://www.ctvnews.ca/health/article/i-pretty-well-would-have-died-on-the-operating-table-canadian-patient-shares-ordeal-on-long-wait-list-for-colonoscopy/) and [education](https://thelocal.to/education-toronto-district-school-board-funding/) systems are [crumbling](https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/post-secondary-cuts-1.7387175), while provincial governments break new ground in privatization efforts.

While the causes of these trends are no doubt complex, much of it comes down [insufficient](https://albertaworker.ca/news/new-budget-shows-ucp-underfunding-health-spending/) [public](https://www.fundourschools.ca/news/ricardo-tranjan-ontarios-core-education-funding-has-dropped-by-1500-per-student-since-2018) [spending](https://www.policyalternatives.ca/news-research/shock-and-awe-in-ontario-big-numbers-hide-the-truth/) in those areas. The flip side of inadequate spending is insufficient revenue. In recent decades, Canada's [federal](https://macleans.ca/politics/ottawa/harper-changes-canada-a-cut-at-a-time/) and provincial governments, [especially in Ontario](https://www.policyalternatives.ca/news-research/bleeding-the-patient-tracking-five-years-of-ontario-revenue-reductions/), have issued tax cuts that have mostly [benefited the wealthy](https://rabble.ca/economy/fords-record-transfer-of-wealth-to-the-wealthy/) or [businesses](https://www.ipolitics.ca/news/liberals-unveil-14b-in-business-tax-breaks-to-help-offset-impact-of-trump-tax-cuts), making Canada's tax system more regressive, while reducing revenues available to fund public services and investment in public goods.

As we saw demonstrated in charts two and three, there is a connection between the progressiveness of a tax system, social and economic inequality and the spending priorities of governments. Each dollar lost into regressive tax loopholes for the rich represents a wasted opportunity for something better.

Partial inclusion of capital gains is one of the most hefty tax expenditures by Canadian governments each year. From 2019 to 2024, the Canadian federal government [spent over](https://www.canada.ca/en/department-finance/services/publications/federal-tax-expenditures/2024/part-6.html#Partial-inclusion-of-capital-gains) \$168 billion to fund the capital gains exemption. That's about \$15 billion less than federal tax expenditures on the [Canada Child Benefit](https://www.canada.ca/en/department-finance/services/publications/federal-tax-expenditures/2024/part-4.html#Canada-Child-Benefit) in the same time span, a program that made a real impact on child poverty.

The chart below compares annual federal tax expenditures on the capital gains loophole versus the Canada Health Transfer (CHT) from 2019 to 2024. The CHT is the federal government's main way of contributing to the funding of Canada's health care systems, which exist under provincial jurisdiction.

In total, the Canadian federal government spent about \$168 billion on the capital gains exclusion over five years, an average of about \$26 billion per year. That means the federal government spent on average around 65% as much on making half of capital gains tax free – mostly for the wealthy and corporations – as they did on the main transfer that funds health care. In 2021, tax-free capital gains cost the public almost much (91%) as the entire CHT.

Now, this is only the federal side of taxation. Provincial governments also issue taxes on capital gains and spend public money on excluding half of capital gains from income taxes. From 2019 to 2024, the government of Ontario, which is engaged in a brutal austerity agenda, posted tax expenditures of \$12.3 billion on the partial inclusion of capital gains, an average of \$2.46 billion each year.

Ontario's public schools are [quite literally falling apart](https://fixourschools.ca/15-billion-repair-backlog/) due to [decades of chronic under-funding](https://thelocal.to/education-toronto-district-school-board-funding/) and [under-spending](https://www.osstf.on.ca/en-CA/news/ford-government-continues-to-underfund-public-education-and-shortchange-students-in-ontario.aspx) (not even spending up to the already too low budgeted amounts). Yet the province spent enough on the capital gains loophole to cover almost all of the province's notorious school repair backlog, as the shortfall in repair and investment has [grown to \$12.7 billion](https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/toronto/ontario-fao-school-repair-construction-shortfall-1.7412722) by the end of 2024.

And the partial inclusion loophole is only the most generous helping of tax breaks for high income and corporate tax filers. Total expenditures on capital gains are much higher – nearly \$65 billion was spent in 2021 ([p. 20](https://centreforfuturework.ca/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/Capital-Gains-Chartbook.pdf)).

For example, last year just under \$5 billion was spent to allow the capital gains of investment and mutual fund corporations to be [flowed to their shareholders](https://www.canada.ca/en/department-finance/services/publications/federal-tax-expenditures/2023/part-7.html#Refundable-capital-gains-tax-for-investment-corporations,-mutual-fund-corporations-and-mutual-fund-trusts), where instead of being treated like corporate profit, it gets much better tax treatment as individual capital gains. Another \$2 billion was spent so that small business owners could enjoy a [lifetime capital gains tax exemption](https://www.canada.ca/en/department-finance/services/publications/federal-tax-expenditures/2023/part-5.html#Lifetime-Capital-Gains-Exemption) valued at nearly a million dollars.

## Human need versus tax treats for the rich

When put side-by-side to public expenditures that actually meet human and social needs, the scale of the public cost of the capital gains exemption – the favourite tax loophole of the investor class – borders on the absurd, especially considering the level of need in so many key areas.

We can see plainly here one of the ways that taxation is connected to [systems of class power](https://mronline.org/2017/12/27/taxes-inequality-and-class-power/). Tax systems can be used influence the spending priorities of the state, which can have sweeping effects on society.

In this case, the class that has a bounty of valuable assets to sell – stocks, bonds, mutual funds, debt equity, business equity, investment properties, and so on – are influencing the state to prioritize giving them massive tax breaks at the expense of everyone else, resulting in the upward redistribution of income and wealth, then further entrenchment of their power.

As a result of this pressure, Canada's regressive tax system has grown into one of the most favourable toward capital income among mature, industrial economies. Instead of spending tens of billions in public funds each year to provide a tax gift mostly to the rich and large corporations, the capital gains inclusion loophole should be closed entirely.

It isn't just that the raised revenue could go toward pro-social ends, buffeting social systems that have suffered generations of neglect, but could be a turning point in the
