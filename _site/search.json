    "text": "Header on union members missing out (for now)\nHowever, those gains have not been evenly distributed. There is one group in particular that has – so far – been left out of the wage growth trend.\nThat would be union members, most of whom have endured stagnant or declining real wages. In the private sector, union members had paltry wage gains of just 30 cents (+0.81%) an hour from 2014 to 2024. Their public sector colleagues actually had real hourly wage losses of $1.26 (-2.5%) over that time.\nIt was another story for workers in non-unionized workplaces. Non-members in the private sector saw strong wage gains of $2.50 an hour (+13.9%). Non-unionized employees the public sector saw more modest gains of 40 cents an hour (+2.5%) but they are predominantly professionals and managers with already very high wages.\nWhy are union members, who have traditionally enjoyed higher wages, now losing out during a time of historic wage gains? To a large extent, it is down to timing and the method used to get a raise.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMuch of the private sector pay bump for non-unionized workers came from job-switching. In the past few years, many workers have either lost or left low-wage jobs in favor of better jobs with higher pay. It isn’t so simple to leave one unionized job for another to get a raise. Those types of jobs are more scarce and pay structures under collective agreements are often more strictly tied to seniority.\nFor most union members, the only option is to wait for an existing contract to end, then hope that the next one that includes a real raise. Most collective agreements in Canada are three to five years long. Workers with contracts that were signed close to the onset of the cost-of-living crisis in 2021-2022 have witnessed their real wages sputter while they wait for a new deal.\nIn the years to come, it is likely that private sector workers will regain the longstanding union wage premium, as pre-COL crisis contracts expire and new deals are signed. Seeing other private sector unions get results with large-scale, co-ordinated negotiation and strike action will hopefully be a wind in the sails of union militancy.\nIn the public sector, unionized workers also have to contend with bargaining interference and wage suppression by governments determined run roughshod over labour rights."

    "text": "Even after growth, wages are still far too low\nAverage private sector wages have indeed grown heartily. But have they grown enough? In the chart below, average real wages for private sector employees are shown for each quintile of hourly income over the last 10 years.\nWages have grown across the board, the most at the bottom of the wage distribution. In the lowest income quintile, average wages rose by nearly one-fifth (18.7%), which amounted to an increase of only $2.68 per hour. Workers in the next lowest quintile had healthy growth (+10.7%) as well, a pay raise of about $2.22 per hour.\nDespite strong wage growth, wages for many workers are still too low, especially given the baked-in price increases in staples like food, shelter, and energy. Surely, it is not bad vibes keeping the good news from the 40% of private sector workers that have hourly earnings just above or under the average national rental wage of $22.50.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIt has been a really great time to be one of the top income takers in the country.

    "section": "Union members are being left behind",
    "text": "Union members are being left behind\nWhile many workers are seeing their wages grow, union members are notably missing out. Most have experienced stagnant or even declining real wages.\nIn the private sector, unionized workers saw their hourly wages increase by a meager 30 cents (+0.9%) from 2014 to 2024. Public sector union members fared even worse, with real hourly wages dropping by 94 cents an hour (-2.3%) over the same period.\nBy contrast, non-unionized workers have seen substantial wage growth. In the private sector, non-union employees enjoyed an impressive $4.15 (+14.2%) increase in hourly pay. Non-union public sector workers, primarily professionals and managers with already high earnings, experienced more modest gains of $1.12 (+2.7%).\nHistorically, private sector union members earned higher average wages than their non-unionized peers. But since the onset of the cost-of-living crisis in 2021-22, that advantage has eroded. Today, average wages for non-unionized workers exceed those of unionized workers by about 40 cents per hour.\nIn 2024, there were over 3.3 million union members in the public sector and another 2 million in the private sector – that’s about three in ten paid employees in the country who have largely been left behind as wages rise.\nWhy are union members, long known for securing better wages, falling behind during this period of historic wage growth?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOne major factor is job-switching. Much of the wage growth among non-unionized private sector workers has been driven by employees leaving low-paying jobs for higher-paying opportunities. This path to higher earnings isn’t as straightforward for union members.\nUnionized jobs, particularly in the private sector, are relatively scarce. Opportunities to move from one unionized position to another are limited. Even when such moves are possible, the wage structures in unionized workplaces are typically tied to seniority, making it difficult to achieve significant pay increases by switching jobs.\nFor union members, wage increases depend on collective bargaining. Contracts, which typically last three to five years in Canada, lock in wage rates for the duration of the agreement. Workers whose contracts were negotiated just before or during the early stages of the cost-of-living crisis have seen their real wages stagnate or decline as inflation eroded their purchasing power."

    "text": "Private sector union wages are treading water\nFor union members, wage increases depend on collective bargaining – which ultimately depends on the right to strike. Contracts, which typically last three to five years in Canada, lock in wage rates for the duration of the agreement. Workers whose contracts were negotiated just before or during the early stages of the cost-of-living crisis in 2020-2021 have seen their real wages stagnate or decline as inflation eroded their purchasing power.\nA closer look at the data for private sector union members reveals the extent of the stagnation. The chart underneath shows average wages for private sector union members or those that are covered by a CA by each quintile of hourly earnings.\nWhile unionized workers in the lowest wage quintile saw some gains—an $1.75 increase (+11%) over the past decade—most others have seen little to no growth when accounting for inflation. Across most earnings levels, private sector union wages have barely moved, leaving workers no better off than a decade ago – and wondering when their pay will reflect the broader trend of wage growth.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Coming Battle for Fair Wages\nThe silver lining for private sector union members is that change may be on the horizon. As pre-cost-of-living crisis contracts expire and new agreements are negotiated, workers and their unions will likely push for significant raises to make up for lost ground. After a decade of treading water, the demand for better pay will be stronger than ever.\nCanadian union members can look to the example set by the United Auto Workers (UAW) in the United States. In a highly strategic and combative campaign, the UAW recently secured a 25% wage increase over four years—an impressive victory after decades of uphill struggle.\nIf Canadian unions take a similarly bold and strategic approach, the next wave of collective bargaining could bring long-overdue gains for unionized workers, restoring the wage premium they have historically enjoyed."

    "section": "Private sector union wages are treading water",
    "text": "Private sector union wages are treading water\nFor union members, wage increases depend on collective bargaining – which ultimately depends on the right to strike. Contracts, which typically last three to five years in Canada, lock in wage rates for the duration of the agreement. Workers whose contracts were negotiated just before or during the early stages of the cost-of-living crisis in 2020-2021 have seen their real wages stagnate or decline as inflation eroded their purchasing power.\nA closer look at the data for private sector union members reveals the extent of the stagnation. The chart underneath shows average wages for private sector union members or those that are covered by a CA by each quintile of hourly earnings.\nWhile unionized workers in the lowest wage quintile saw some gains—an $1.75 increase (+11%) over the past decade—most others have seen little to no growth when accounting for inflation. Across most earnings levels, private sector union wages have barely moved, leaving most workers no better off than a decade ago – and wondering when their pay will reflect the broader trend of wage growth.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Coming Battle for Fair Wages\nThe silver lining for private sector union members is that change may be on the horizon. As pre-cost-of-living crisis contracts expire and new agreements are negotiated, workers and their unions will likely push for significant raises to make up for lost ground. After a decade of treading water, the demand for major raises that restore lost purchasing power will be stronger than ever.\nCanadian union members are already looking to the example set by the United Auto Workers (UAW) in the United States. In a highly strategic and combative campaign, the UAW recently secured a 25% wage increase over four years—an impressive victory after decades of uphill struggle.\nIf Canadian unions take a similarly bold and strategic approach, the next wave of collective bargaining could bring long-overdue gains for unionized workers, restoring the wage premium they have historically enjoyed."

    "text": "For over a decade, real wage growth has been elusive for unionized workers. While non-union wages have climbed steadily, unionized workers have faced stagnation—and in some cases, decline. Yet despite what average wage data might suggest, unions still confer a higher paycheck for most workers, especially those in lower-wage or non-standard employment.\nMy last analysis uncovered that real wages for union members have been stuck in limbo for at least a decade. Since 2014, real wages have risen less than 1% in the private sector and actually dropped by 2.3 percent in the public sector. Over that time, the average wages of non-union workers grew to surpass unionized workers by about $1.43 per hour in the private sector. In the public sector, the gap was even higher at $3.05 hourly.\nDoes this mean that it is no longer worth it for workers to create and participate in unions? The short answer—absolutely not.

Now that non-union wages are higher “on average” it is worth asking whose wages are higher?\nThe charts below show the difference in average hourly wages in 2024 between union members and non-members across different sectors, occupations, and employment statuses. Let’s start with the private sector.\nAs we can see below, whether or not unions confer a wage advantage depends highly on what kind of job you have. In the private sector, union members had higher average wages in the vast majority of non-professional occupations – as well as a few professional categories like education or business jobs.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIt’s noteworthy that as one goes down the occupational wage ladder, the union wage advantage becomes more consistent.

    "text": "For over a decade, real wage growth has been elusive for unionized workers. While non-union wages have climbed steadily, unionized workers have faced stagnation – and in some cases, decline. Yet despite what average wage data might suggest, union membership still secures higher pay for most workers, especially at the lower end of the wage distribution where workers need it the most.\nMy last analysis uncovered that real wages for union members have been stuck in limbo for at least a decade. Since 2014, real wages have risen less than 1% in the private sector and actually dropped by 2.3% in the public sector. Over that time, the average wages of non-union workers grew to surpass unionized workers by about $1.43 per hour in the private sector. In the public sector, the gap was even higher at $3.05 hourly.\nDoes this mean that it is no longer worth it for workers to form or join unions? Absolutely not. Union membership is virtually always in the short and long-term interests of workers – not just to get a bigger paycheck, but also a higher quality of life."

    "text": "Unions delivering for non-professional private sector workers\nEven if we focus solely on average hourly wages, leaving aside other important benefits like pension plans or healthcare coverage, most workers still get ahead by being union members. Average wage data conceals much complexity and difference under the surface. Now that non-union wages are higher “on average” in the private sector, it is worth asking: whose wages are higher?\nThe charts in this post show the difference in average hourly wages in 2024 between non-unionized workers and union members (or non-members still covered by a collective agreement) across different sectors, occupations, and employment arrangements. The source for all data is the Labour Force Survey public use files. Since we are only looking at 2024 wages, the values are not inflation adjusted.\nThe first chart below compares wages across all of the non-managerial job types based on the National Occupation Classification System. Whether or not unions lead to higher wages depends highly on the type of job. In the private sector, union members had higher average wages in the vast majority of non-professional occupations, as well as in a few professional categories like education or business jobs.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAs one goes down the wage ladder, the union advantage becomes more consistent. In occupations with below-average wages, union members consistently held higher wages, with the exception of (1) education and legal assistants, who had roughly equal wages and (2) sales and service occupations, where both wages and union density are very low.\nIn other words, unions are delivering a wage boost where it is needed the most – to workers in lower wage occupations.\nThis finding also implies that the union/non-union divergence in average wages is being driven largely by high-wage professional occupations like doctors or lawyers, where unionization rates tend to be very low due to the nature of these roles."

Generally, the higher the rate of unionization, the better it is for workers.\nStatistics Canada produces some official estimates of union density based on the Labour Force Survey (LFS). One can find, for example, official union density estimates by education level, occupation, or industry. There is an issue using those estimates to draw conclusions about unionization patterns in Canada – is it in the private or public sector?\nUnionization rates are about five times higher in the public sector (76%) than in the private sector (15%), meaning patterns and trends vary greatly by sector. For example, what is average union density in the transportation and warehousing industries in Canada? According to the official estimates, about 40.7% of those workers were unionized in 2023. Yet if we break that down into sector, we see that 82% in the public sector are union members, while only 25% of those in the private sector are.\nSince union rates are always high in one sector and low in another, averages needs to be disaggregated by sector to make sense of the trends in the data. Yet none of StatCan’s official estimate tables are available broken down by sector. It’s possible to pay for a custom tabulation. But to otherwise access that information for free requires using microdata files that demand some level of proficiency with statistical or coding software.\nTo make this open-access data more accessible, I have created an interactive dashboard featuring Canadian union density data from 2006 until (currently) October of 2024. I plan to add live-update capacity in the future to refresh the charts with new LFS data as it is released.\nThe dashboard has charts and tables on union density for 15 variables, always broken down into the public and private sectors, including:\n\nAge\nGender\nEmployment status\nIndustry\nOccupation\nProvince and CMA\nJob tenure\nAnd more!\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDashboard link\n\n\n\nCLICK HERE TO ACCESS DASHBOARD\n\n\n\n\nAll of the calculations are based on the LFS public use microdata files (PUMF), which are LFS data files that have been altered to protect the privacy of respondents, so that researchers can use them freely. Often estimates created with PUMF are very close, but a little bit different from official estimated produced using the original data.\nFor the time being, these values are presented without any measures of estimate quality, like the coefficient of variation or confidence intervals. Producing those estimates from PUMF is a major project unto itself, so maybe some day, but for now these values are presented as is and should be used with caution.\n\n\n\nUnion density has been defined in slightly different ways. This dashboard is aligned with the definition used by StatCan in most recent analyses which is the percentage of paid employees that are members of a trade union. That means that only paid employees are used in the denominator for calculating density rates, meaning unemployed workers, self-employed people, unpaid family workers, and those not in the labour force are not included.\n\n\n\nIn the future, I will probably write in more detail about how to craft a dashboard like this, but for now I’ll mention that it is made with a combination of:\n\nQuarto’s dashboard format to create the responsive layout and integrate it seamlessly with this site, which is also made with Quarto;\nDatawrapper for live, interactive charts that work well on just about any screen size;\nR to create the data pipeline, do the calculations, and create the charts by accessing the Datawrapper API;\nAnd a sprinkling of Javascript to allow the user to select variables without a Shiny server."

I plan to add live-update capacity in the future to refresh the charts with new LFS data as it is released.\nThe dashboard has charts and tables on union density for 15 variables, always broken down into the public and private sectors, including:\n\nAge\nGender\nEmployment status\nIndustry\nOccupation\nProvince and CMA\nJob tenure\nAnd more!\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDashboard link\n\n\n\nCLICK HERE TO ACCESS DASHBOARD\n\n\n\n\nAll of the calculations are based on the LFS public use microdata files (PUMF), which are LFS data files that have been altered to protect the privacy of respondents, so that researchers can use them freely. Often estimates created with PUMF are very close, but a little bit different from official estimated produced using the original data.\nFor the time being, these values are presented without any measures of estimate quality, like the coefficient of variation or confidence intervals. Producing those estimates from PUMF is a major project unto itself, so maybe some day, but for now these values are presented as is and should be used with caution.\n\n\n\nUnion density has been defined in slightly different ways. This dashboard is aligned with the definition used by StatCan in most recent analyses which is the percentage of paid employees that are members of a trade union. That means that only paid employees are used in the denominator for calculating density rates, meaning unemployed workers, self-employed people, unpaid family workers, and those not in the labour force are not included.\n\n\n\nIn the future, I will probably write in more detail about how to craft a dashboard like this, but for now I’ll mention that it is made with a combination of:\n\nQuarto’s dashboard format to create the responsive layout and integrate it seamlessly with this site, which is also made with Quarto;\nDatawrapper for live, interactive charts that work well on just about any screen size;\nR to create the data pipeline, do the calculations, and create the charts by accessing the Datawrapper API;\nAnd a sprinkling of Javascript to allow the user to select variables without a Shiny server."

Across sectors and union membership, only a very small minority of employees were doing both paid and unpaid overtime in the same week.\nIn the private sector, the vast majority of union members were working paid overtime only – they were about 1.8 times more likely to be working paid overtime than non-unionized workers.

    "text": "A thought experiment on the value of union protection\nLet’s try a simple thought experiment to roughly quantify the value of extending this protection against free labour to all workers. What if, all other things being equal, employers had to pay non-union members for their overtime work at the same rate that union members. That means in the private sector, workers were paid for 88.6% of their overtime hours instead of just half, while those the public sector would be paid for 50% instead of 20% of their overtime.\n\nPrivate sector\nIn the private sector, about 1.5 million non-unionized workers did 542 million hours of overtime total. Their bosses only paid them for half, which worked out to 281 million hours. If we assume that workers are paid the standard overtime rate of 1.5 times that works out to an average of $63 per hour, resulting in an overtime wage bill of $17.6B or about $11,700 per worker.\nIf they had the same incidence of paid overtime as union members? They would have been paid for 480 million hours instead, which would have worked out to $30.3 billion in wages or $20,000 per worker. That would be an aggregate wage increase of $13.1B or an additional $8,733 in overtime pay per worker.\nWe can also do those calculations the other way around. What would happen to the overtime pay of union members if they had no protection against unpaid overtime? In this situation, they would only have been paid for 72.5 (50%) out of 144 million hours, leading to total overtime pay of just $3.98 billion – a decline of $3 billion or $11,320 per worker without unions.\n\n\nPublic sector\nIn the public sector, the distinction was less extreme. If non-union workers had the same rate of paid overtime as union members, they would have been paid for 33 million (50%) instead of 13 million hours of overtime (21%), leading to a wage bump of $1.6 billion.\nOn the other hand, if public sector union members were paid for their extra work like non-members, they would only have been paid for 48.5 million, instead of 117 million hours of overtime. As a result, their overtime wages would shrink to 3.19 billion – that’s a drop of $4.6 billion or $7,050 per worker."

Very few employees report doing both in the same week regardless of the sector or collective agreement coverage.\nIn the private sector, union members are far more likely to work paid overtime only – about 1.8 times more likely than non-unionized workers.

If they were paid at the same rate as union workers, they would have been compensated for 50% of their overtime hours instead of 21%, resulting in a wage increase of $1.6 billion.\nFor union workers, losing protections would mean being paid for just 48.5 million overtime hours instead of 117 million. Their overtime wages would drop by $4.6 billion, or $7,050 per worker. While the overtime gap is an issue, perhaps the more pressing problem in the public sector is the very high prevalence of unpaid overtime for union members and non-members alike."

    "text": "Canada’s tax system is notoriously unfair. At every twist and turn, it is set up to favour those who make their income just by owning property, rather than those who must work for wages. One of the most stunning examples of this bias toward property income is the capital gains exemption loophole.\nCapital gains are profits made by selling assets that have increased in value. If one buys company shares worth $10,000 and sells them down the road for $20,000, that’s a capital gain of $10,000. Most people own little to no capital assets and so enjoy significant capital gains only very rarely – it is mostly the territory of the wealthy and corporations, who buy and sell assets for gain with regularity.\nSince 2003, only 50% of income made by capital gains has been subjected to taxes – that is to say that half of capital gains were entirely tax free. Income paid to labour or some transfers like EI payments are always entirely subject to income taxes. Yet, if you are a landlord, and just sold your third investment property for a hefty return – half of that income would be totally tax free.\nTax justice advocates have long called for closing this capital gains tax loophole, which is set up to massively benefit wealthy property owners and corporations. Canada’s Liberal government, under pressure to pursue some kind of tax reform, both to comply with OECD-wide tax changes and to fund their own spending agenda, announced intent to raise the rate of inclusion on capital gains over $250,000 from 50 to 66% early in 2024. This amounts to a very small effective increase in capital gains tax rates, which are still extremely generous.\nUnder the new tax plan, the 50% inclusion rate still applies to gains of under a quarter million dollars, while the new rate of two-thirds applies on gains over that threshold. In other words, a very large portion of that income is still completely tax free. Since the threshold for the new tax rate is so high, only a very small number of high income individuals would be impacted. Businesses would have their gains taxed entirely at the higher rate, but it was coupled with some rather generous tax benefits to small and medium sized businesses to offset much of the impact."

In a baffling turn of events, the ailing Liberals pulled the capital gains tax reform out into a separate bill, instead of passing it with the budget as tax measures usually are.\nLess than a year later, they extinguished their own bill when they pulled to plug on parliament in a desperate move to stave off the inevitable end. Snatching defeat from the jaws of victory, Trudeau and company made an unforced error, fumbling the ball at the goal line.\nIt has to be one of the main themes of the Trudeau government, which had to be arm-twisted into cynically following through with a few modest reforms and (always means-tested) social programs – another missed opportunity to produce meaningful change.\nIn this case, it is a squandered chance to introduce meaningful tax reform into a country with a tax system so regressive, it should be an ongoing national scandal. They missed the moment not only because they scored an own-goal at the very last second, but because their proposals – focus-group tested “progressive” on one hand and austerity-hawk neoliberal on the other – were far too modest and limited in vision to begin with.\nThe new rate of two-thirds falls far short of even Canada’s historical high, when in the 1990s three-quarters (75%) of capital gains were included in taxable income. To fix Canada’s regressive tax system, it is essential that income on capital and property is treated like income on labour, meaning all of it is subject to taxation.\nData from two dozen European countries shows that, at least in mature industrial economies, having higher capital gains tax rates, which are likely indicative of higher rates of capital income tax in general, is linked to higher labour productivity, lower inequality, and higher spending priority on essential social services like health and education."

This analysis relies on data published by the Tax Foundation on the top capital gains tax rates for individuals in over twenty European countries.\nNote, up until now we have been talking about the capital gains inclusion rate in Canada, how much is counted as taxable income, while this data deals with the actual top tax rates on capital gains in each country. In most countries, personal capital gains are entirely included in taxable income, though subject to different tax rates.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThere are two data sets, one from 2011-2014 and one from 2019-2023. I’m not aware of another data source to fill those years in, other than meticulous manual gathering from public records, which isn’t on the table right now.\nPutting this dataset together requires some simplification for the purposes of comparison, since the way capital gains are treated can vary greatly across tax systems. Hover over countries marked by an asterisk to see notes on the data provided by the Tax Foundation.\nThis data set was combined with macro level economic data from the World Inequality Database and the OECD’s Productivity Statistics Database for comparison against capital gains tax rates."

It is no coincidence that countries with the highest standards of living in the world also tend to be the most productive – it is a necessary, but not a sufficient condition for prosperity.\nThe chart below compares the average top personal CGT rate on the horizontal axis to average labour productivity on the vertical axis, across each time period. There is a clear positive correlation between capital gains taxes and labour productivity, where more productive countries tend to tax capital gains at higher rates and vice versa.\nSuch a finding concurs with a growing body of research demonstrating that as national economies mature and grow more productive, they also tend to tax capital income in general at higher rates. Researchers at the Centre for Analysis of Taxation found that in the United Kingdom, found that overly generous CGT rates negatively impacted labour productivity by encouraging people to work in low-productivity, solo-proprietorship businesses:\n\nCurrently capital gains are taxed at much lower rates than income. This encourages individuals to work in a form that allows them to be paid in capital gains, for example setting up a personal service company through which they get paid, and later extracting the income as capital gains by liquidating the company.\nA negative side effect of low CGT rates is the proliferation of these businesses, which not only reduce the overall tax take, but hamper productivity by having people working in ways that are less efficient but are individually optimal because of the tax saving. This contributes to the regularly diagnosed ‘long tail’ of unproductive firms in the UK. (p. 2)\n\nWhile the UK has had especially permissive laws and regulations on these forms of income-shifting, the tax incentive to shift labour income into capital income by solo-incorporation remains strong in Canada (p. 22), even though personal service corporations receive less favourable tax treatment than in the UK. It is widely recognized by experts that Canada’s economy is overly reliant on small enterprises that are naturally less productive due to economies of scale. Could our permissive capital gains taxation system be contributing to this problem?\nOther researchers have suggested additional ways capital income taxation can improve labour productivity. The first is that raising the share of tax revenue from capital presents an opportunity to lower the relative tax burden on labour, which is known to have a distortionary impact on productivity. Second, is that raising more revenue from capital affords an opportunity to raise government spending in areas that are known to improve productivity."

    "section": "Higher gains tax rates, higher productivity",
    "text": "Higher gains tax rates, higher productivity\nLabour productivity, the measure of how much value is produced by an hour of labour or by each worker employed, is more directly related to well-being than GDP and GDP growth. It is no coincidence that countries with the highest standards of living in the world also tend to be the most productive – it is a necessary, but not a sufficient condition for prosperity.\nMore productive countries tend to tax capital gains at higher rates. In the past, I have written about how Canada’s capital gains inclusion rate has little bearing on productivity growth. Yet, when looking at an international dataset of industrial economies, there is a clear association between the level of productivity achieved by an economy and the CGT rate.\nThe chart below compares the average top personal CGT rate on the horizontal axis to average labour productivity on the vertical axis, across each time period.1 There is a clear positive correlation between capital gains taxes and labour productivity, where more productive countries tend to tax capital gains at higher rates and vice versa.2\nSuch a finding concurs with research demonstrating that as economies industrialize, mature and grow more productive, they also tend to tax capital income at higher rates.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHow are capital gains tax rates connected to labour productivity?\nWhat is the connection between capital gains tax rates and productivity? We have heard ad nauseum about how even a modest increase in capital gains taxes will destroy productivity and crater Canada’s economy.\nIf that is the case, why are the most productive countries also the ones that tax capital gains – and capital in general – at the highest rates?\n\nPromoting proliferation of small businesses\nResearchers at the Centre for Analysis of Taxation found that in the United Kingdom, found that overly generous CGT rates negatively impacted labour productivity by encouraging people to work in low-productivity, small and solo-proprietorship businesses in order to gain tax advantages:\n\nCurrently capital gains are taxed at much lower rates than income. This encourages individuals to work in a form that allows them to be paid in capital gains, for example setting up a personal service company through which they get paid, and later extracting the income as capital gains by liquidating the company.\nA negative side effect of low CGT rates is the proliferation of these businesses, which not only reduce the overall tax take, but hamper productivity by having people working in ways that are less efficient but are individually optimal because of the tax saving. This contributes to the regularly diagnosed ‘long tail’ of unproductive firms in the UK. (p. 2)\n\nWhile the UK has had especially permissive laws and regulations on these forms of income-shifting, the tax incentive to shift labour income into capital income by solo or small business incorporation remains strong in Canada (p. 22), even though personal service corporations receive less favourable tax treatment than in the UK.\nFirm size and productivity are intuitively linked by economy of scale. Larger firms have a natural productivity advantage over smaller firms due to the efficiency increases of economies of scale – they can access much more capital, invest in more machinery and IP, hire more workers, and build larger facilities for them to work at. For that reason, the most productive industries tend to be the domain of large firms and vice versa.\nIt is widely recognized that workers in Canada are less productive on average than some peer countries, notably the U.S., due to our relative over reliance on small enterprises.\nCanada’s tax system has an unusually generous treatment of capital gains, especially when small and medium sized businesses are involved, which one tax researcher describes as an “endless gateway to tax-minimizing and economy distorting stratagems.” It is reasonable to hypothesize that the Canadian tax system’s preference for capital gains could be contributing to this problem by encouraging the proliferation of small incorporated businesses.\n\n\nIncentivizing productivity-killing financial speculation\nWhen a business invests into producing goods and services for sale, we can consider that a productive activity that fulfills some social use. To profit in this way requires the exploitation of workers, but that is besides the point here, which is that these activities produce wealth in the form of real goods and services.\nHowever, investors can find many ways to make a profit. Financial or speculative activities can be immensely profitable, but only involve assets being exchanged between parties, for example, stock or currency trading. When an asset is sold at a higher price than it was bought for, that is a capital gain – the profit is purely financial because nothing of value has been produced, only changed hands.\nA lax and overly generous system of capital gains taxation therefore directly incentivizes zero-productivity speculative activity, which often stems from low-productivity sectors like construction. Research done by Canadians for Tax Fairness has shown that the 50% capital gains loophole has helped blow up the housing bubble and driven rents up by encouraging the financialization of housing with tremendous tax savings on the sale of investment properties.\nSurely, the Canadian economy’s reliance on a housing bubble has been worsened by the tax system’s strong preference for capital gains – as investment properties are flipped after a few years of surging prices – which in turn has dragged on productivity.\nIn demographic terms, much of Canada’s former manufacturing workforce, mostly men with high school or college level education, has shifted into residential and commercial construction.\nLabour productivity levels has been low and stagnant for over 40 years in the construction sector for many reasons. One widely recognized reason for construction’s productivity problem is the highly fragmentary nature of the sector, which is composed mostly of very small, low productivity firms that pay low wages.\n\n\nOffsetting labour taxes and funding public investment\nA higher capital gains tax regime could also impact productivity in positive ways. The first is that raising the share of tax revenue from capital presents an opportunity to lower the relative tax burden on labour, which can negatively impact productivity.\nExcessive taxation of labour income can reduce aggregate demand, which can harm productivity because it “reduces the market size for new innovations and has an adverse effect on domestic rates of innovation” (p. 3). By alleviating the tax burden on the working class majority of people, the general pool of money (and credit) available for (mostly) spending, but also saving and investing rises.\nCapital gains taxation can have another positive impact on productivity, in that raising more revenue from capital affords an opportunity to raise government spending without adding to the tax burden on labour income (p. 4).\nWhile much economic theory treats government spending and taxation as only an economic negative, it is crystal clear that spending in certain areas can potentially enhance labour productivity. In economic terms, this is described as the distinction between productive and unproductive government spending.\nResearch has found that by improving the health, well-being, and skill level of the workforce, state expenditures in areas such as such as education, and health care can increase the amount of value produced by workers. Likewise, investments into infrastructure and public goods can also enhance labour productivity.\nAnother obvious productivity boosting avenue of spending would be government spending on research, development, innovation, and promoting the widespread adoption of new technologies. This is an area of public investment that both levels of Canadian governments have been lagging behind for a long time."

    "text": "Higher gains tax rates, lower inequality\nThere is yet another pathway for capital gains taxation to impact labour productivity – social and economic inequality. Experts widely conclude that productivity and economic inequality are intrinsically linked in what is often called the Inclusivity (or Inequality)-Productivity Nexus.\nIn general, workers in societies that are more equal grow more productive, while rising inequality can have a dampening effect on productivity growth. Researchers at the OECD found that the relationship is based on how inequality is both caused by and drives labour market outcomes at the bottom of the income distribution:\n\nThe main link is via high income inequalities reducing investments in human capital, which in turn lead to diminished prospects for productivity growth. Hence … a strong emphasis is put on the impact of poverty and inequality of opportunity on growth.\n\nBelow the chart displays the connection between income inequality – measured as the share of income captured by the top 10% – and the top personal capital gains tax rate for countries in the dataset. As expected, countries that are more equal in income terms have higher CGT rate than less equal countries and vice versa.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe connection between capital gains tax rates and economic inequality more intuitive than with productivity. Regressive tax systems are usually that way because they give very favourable treatment to capital income compared to labour income. Income from owning and selling property is vital to those on top of the class hierarchy, while the vast majority of people own no capital assets to sell in the first place and so seldom have significant capital gains ever.\nHigher capital gains taxes could directly contribute to reducing inequality by taxing a preferred source of typically low-tax income for very wealthy people and large corporations, then using that to invest in public services and public goods that reduce inequality.\nIt is very likely that countries with higher CGT rates tax higher income at higher rates and are less permissive with high income tax filers – in other words, it is one marker for having a more progressive overall tax system."

There is a well-known connection between a government’s ability to raise revenue (taxes as a share of GDP) and economic growth, with increased tax revenue supporting higher government social spending.\nResearch has established a connection between government tax revenue and both healthcare and education spending. Mostly this has been studied in low and middle income countries in the context of development, but we can see something like this relationship on display in industrialized, European economies as well.\nCapital gains tax rates were strongly related to government expenditures on health, education, and social protection (e.g. social security payments) relative to gross domestic product. Countries that had higher CGT rates – countries that tend to be both more equal and productive – also display a higher priority on social expenditures that support the health and wellness of the population.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPublic spending in areas like health, education, and social security or income support have a well-known re-distributional effect, resulting in reduced income and wealth inequality. Countries with higher tax rates had more progressive tax systems overall, and were more likely to use the revenue raised pro-social ends – and not things like paying for extremely regressive tax breaks for the rich."

In the scatter plots above, those countries have not been included because they stand apart from the general trend in terms of their zero tax rate.\nIt is likely more appropriate to compare those zero rate countries as a group to countries that do tax gains. Below, the table shows the average measures used above for countries with a zero rate of capital gains tax versus all other countries.\nAmong countries that didn’t tax capital gains at all, there were two high productivity (Belgium and Switzerland), and two low productivity countries (Slovakia and Slovenia), and one with productivity data so cooked, it isn’t worth considering (Luxembourg).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAt first glance, the zero rate countries are vastly more productive, but this is mostly illusory, due to Luxembourg’s vastly over-inflated productivity statistics bringing up the average.3 Account for that fact and productivity levels are equivalent in the 2011-2012 period, while zero rate countries end up slightly more productive, due to very strong growth by Belgium and Switzerland.\nAs we might expect from our findings so far, countries that do not tax capital gains saw a higher share of income going to the top 10% of income takers in the country compared to those that did tax capital gains. Likewise, the zero rate countries had a much smaller share of social spending in GDP, indicating a lower priority on government spending that reduces poverty and improves health and well-being."

About how very modest efforts to raise taxes on high incomes and corporate profits are causing Canada’s economic problems. How innovation and productivity will be crushed.\nSo on and so forth. It will go much further than killing the capital gains tax reform, forming the tip of the spear thrust toward an even more regressive tax system.\nA striking episode of evidence free fear-mongering on behalf of capital came from the C.D. Howe Institute, which issued a report predicting a very small increase in capital gains taxes could inflict billions in economic damage, costing hundreds of thousands of jobs. Can a truly modest tax increase on capital bring about economic mass destruction according to so-called “financial theory?”\nWell, what can we observe from data when countries actually change their capital gains tax rates in the real world? According to the Tax Foundation’s data, 2011-2012 were banner years for capital gains tax reform and likely tax reform in general, as European countries were pursuing somewhat more progressive tax policies in response to the fallout of the Great Recession just a few years prior.\nSeveral countries, some of the largest economies in Europe at that, instituted a change in their CGT rate from 2011 through to 2012. Below are five notable examples of countries that raised their CGT rate in 2012. That includes two that went from having no gains taxes to instituting a CGT rate of 25%, which is near the European average, Austria and Portugal. Italy went in the opposite direction, slashing it’s CGT rate from 45 down to 20%, but it did little to benefit their moribund economy.\nThe table below compares average GDP growth in the decade prior (2001-2011) to the CGT rate change to the tax-year and the next five years (2012-2017). There is not a clear relationship between changes in the CGT rate and economic growth that applies across all countries. Some raised the CGT rate and then outpaced their historical growth trend, while others raised their rates and then slightly under-performed over the next few years.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIt stands to reason that it is possible for changes in the CGT rate to have a macro level economic impact observable in growth rate changes. Yet as we can see plainly, even major changes in the CGT rate, including the shock of moving away from zero capital gains taxes, the impact on growth had to be minimal, with countries mostly staying in line with their long-term growth trajectories.\nNow, I don’t endorse using GDP or GDP growth as a measure of economic well-being, but in this context it yields zero evidence of the doom-and-gloom theorized by certain advocates of capital. Below, we look into the relationship between the CGT rate and some more meaningful variables of interest."

    "text": "Canada’s tax system is notoriously unfair. At every twist and turn, it is set up to favour those who make their income just by owning property, rather than those who must work for wages. One of the most stunning examples of this bias toward property income is the capital gains exemption loophole.\nCapital gains are profits made by selling assets that have increased in value. If one buys company shares worth $10,000 and sells them down the road for $20,000, that’s a capital gain of $10,000. Most people own little to no capital assets and so enjoy significant capital gains only very rarely – it is mostly the territory of the wealthy and corporations, who buy and sell assets for gain with regularity.\nSince 2003, only 50% of income made by capital gains has been subjected to taxes – that is to say that half of capital gains were entirely tax free. Income paid to labour or some transfers like EI payments are always entirely subject to income taxes. Yet, if you are a landlord, and just sold your third investment property for a hefty return – half of that income would be totally tax free.\nTax justice advocates have long called for closing this capital gains tax loophole, which is set up to massively benefit wealthy property owners and corporations. Canada’s Liberal government, under pressure to pursue some kind of tax reform, both to comply with OECD-wide tax changes and to fund their own spending agenda, announced intent to raise the rate of inclusion on capital gains over $250,000 from 50 to 66% early in 2024. This amounts to a very small effective increase in capital gains tax rates, which are still extremely generous.\nUnder the new tax plan, the 50% inclusion rate still applies to gains of under a quarter million dollars, while the new rate of two-thirds applies on gains over that threshold. In other words, a very large portion of that income is still completely tax free. Since the threshold for the new tax rate is so high, only a very small number of high income individuals would be impacted. Businesses would have their gains taxed entirely at the higher rate, but it was coupled with some rather generous tax benefits to small and medium sized businesses to offset much of the impact."

They missed the moment not only because they scored an own-goal at the very last second, but because their proposals – focus-group tested “progressive” on one hand and austerity-hawk neoliberal on the other – were far too modest and limited in vision to begin with.\nThe new rate of two-thirds falls far short of even Canada’s historical high, when in the 1990s three-quarters (75%) of capital gains were included in taxable income. To fix Canada’s regressive tax system, it is essential that income on capital and property is treated like income on labour, meaning all of it is subject to taxation.\nData from two dozen European countries shows that, at least in mature industrial economies, having higher capital gains tax rates, which are likely indicative of higher rates of capital income tax in general, is linked to higher labour productivity, lower inequality, and higher spending priority on essential social services like health and education."

In most countries, personal capital gains are entirely included in taxable income, though subject to different tax rates.\nThere are two data sets, one from 2011-2014 and one from 2019-2023. I’m not aware of another data source to fill those years in, other than meticulous manual gathering from public records, which isn’t on the table right now.\nPutting this dataset together requires some simplification for the purposes of comparison, since the way capital gains are treated can vary greatly across tax systems.

    "text": "Header on growth rates\nNow, the fate of the small step forward to tax justice looks grim. There is an all out regressive taxation propaganda blitz to ensure that the changes are buried by the next government. We will hear even more about how unfair these changes really are. About how very modest efforts to raise taxes on high incomes and corporate profits are causing Canada’s economic problems. How innovation and productivity will be crushed.\nSo on and so forth. It will go much further than killing the capital gains tax reform, forming the tip of the spear thrust toward an even more regressive tax system.\nA striking episode of evidence free fear-mongering on behalf of capital came from the C.D. Howe Institute, which issued a report predicting a very small increase in capital gains taxes could inflict billions in economic damage, costing hundreds of thousands of jobs. Can a truly modest tax increase on capital bring about economic mass destruction according to so-called “financial theory?”\nWell, what can we observe from data when countries actually change their capital gains tax rates in the real world? According to the Tax Foundation’s data, 2011-2012 were banner years for capital gains tax reform and likely tax reform in general, as European countries were pursuing somewhat more progressive tax policies in response to the fallout of the Great Recession just a few years prior.\nSeveral countries, some of the largest economies in Europe at that, instituted a change in their CGT rate from 2011 through to 2012. Below are five notable examples of countries that raised their CGT rate in 2012. That includes two that went from having no gains taxes to instituting a CGT rate of 25%, which is near the European average, Austria and Portugal. Italy went in the opposite direction, slashing it’s CGT rate from 45 down to 20%, but it did little to benefit their moribund economy.\nThe table below compares average GDP growth in the decade prior (2001-2011) to the CGT rate change to the tax-year and the next five years (2012-2017). There is not a clear relationship between changes in the CGT rate and economic growth that applies across all countries. Some raised the CGT rate and then outpaced their historical growth trend, while others raised their rates and then slightly under-performed over the next few years.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nResearchers at the Centre for Analysis of Taxation found that in the United Kingdom, found that overly generous CGT rates negatively impacted labour productivity by encouraging people to work in low-productivity, solo-proprietorship businesses:\n\nCurrently capital gains are taxed at much lower rates than income. This encourages individuals to work in a form that allows them to be paid in capital gains, for example setting up a personal service company through which they get paid, and later extracting the income as capital gains by liquidating the company.\nA negative side effect of low CGT rates is the proliferation of these businesses, which not only reduce the overall tax take, but hamper productivity by having people working in ways that are less efficient but are individually optimal because of the tax saving. This contributes to the regularly diagnosed ‘long tail’ of unproductive firms in the UK. (p. 2)\n\nWhile the UK has had especially permissive laws and regulations on these forms of income-shifting, the tax incentive to shift labour income into capital income by solo-incorporation remains strong in Canada (p. 22), even though personal service corporations receive less favourable tax treatment than in the UK.\nIt is widely recognized that workers in Canada are less productive on average than many peer countries due to our over reliance on small enterprises that are naturally less productive due to economies of scale. It is likely that our extremely generous tax treatment of capital gains – which one tax researcher describes as an “endless gateway to tax-minimizing and economy distorting stratagems” – is contributing to this problem to some degree.\nOther researchers have suggested additional ways capital income taxation can improve labour productivity. The first is that raising the share of tax revenue from capital presents an opportunity to lower the relative tax burden on labour, which is known to have a distortionary impact on productivity. Second, is that raising more revenue from capital affords an opportunity to raise government spending in areas that are known to improve productivity."

Experts widely conclude that productivity and economic inequality are intrinsically linked in what is often called the Inclusivity (or Inequality)-Productivity Nexus.\nIn general, workers in societies that are more equal grow more productive, while rising inequality can have a dampening effect on productivity growth. Researchers at the OECD found that the relationship is based on how inequality is both caused by and drives labour market outcomes at the bottom of the income distribution:\n\nThe main link is via high income inequalities reducing investments in human capital, which in turn lead to diminished prospects for productivity growth. Hence … a strong emphasis is put on the impact of poverty and inequality of opportunity on growth.\n\nBelow the chart displays the connection between income inequality – measured as the share of income captured by the top 10% – and the top personal capital gains tax rate for countries in the dataset. As expected, countries that are more equal in income terms have higher CGT rate than less equal countries and vice versa.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGiven how concentrated capital gains are at the very top of income distributions, it is not surprising to see that higher CGT rate are associated with lower rates of income inequality.\n&lt;Citations on high income tax filers&gt;."

Below, the table shows the average measures used above for countries with a zero rate of capital gains tax versus all other countries.\nAt first glance, the zero rate countries are vastly more productive, but this is mostly illusory, due to Luxembourg’s vastly over-inflated productivity statistics bringing up the average.2 Account for that fact and productivity levels are equivalent in the 2011-2012 period, while zero rate countries end up slightly more productive, due to very strong growth by Belgium and Switzerland.\nAs we might expect from our findings so far, countries that do not tax capital gains saw a higher share of income going to the top 10% of income takers in the country compared to those that did tax capital gains. Likewise, the zero rate countries had a much smaller share of social spending in GDP, indicating a lower priority on government spending that reduces poverty and improves health and well-being."

Yet, GDP growth has exceeded expectations and average wages finally grew enough to outpace the general rise in prices during peak inflation.\nHow can we square this widespread anguish with seemingly positive economic indicators? Many commentators have mistakenly concluded that the source of this frustration is psychological, that common perceptions of the economy are just out of sync with the big-picture reality. They’ve even made a term for it—the so-called vibecession.

When we talk about disposable income, it means the amount of total income that remains after government transfers are received and taxes are paid. \nIt’s vital to consider income from all sources, not just wages, but also things like pension payments, self-employment, and crucially, investment and property income.Using the concept of total income, we can account for the unique role of debt in shaping household finances. \nIn accounting terms, most household expenses, on things like groceries or rent, are counted as consumption expenditures. Interest payments on credit card, mortgage, educational, and other debts are treated differently, as a one-way financial drain that reduces income available for spending. If you had an income of $3,500 in a month, but interest payments on your mortgage and credit card ate up $500, it is as though you only had $3,000 to spend to begin with. \nOne reason for treating debt this way is that it is a two-way street. Households can also receive debt payments. For example, investors that own debt equity as an asset, like corporate or government bonds, regularly receive a return on it in the form of interest payments. At the very top of the income and wealth hierarchy, households commonly receive more of such investment income than they pay out as interest on their own debts. \nThis dynamic is key to understanding why so many people are still struggling despite cooling inflation and rising real wages."

Since the cost of living crisis accelerated with the increased inflation levels of 2021-2022, people have relied more on debt to fund their consumption. At the same time, the once very manageable costs of holding debt have surged to levels not seen in over 30 years.\nBelow, the chart shows the share of disposable income that is taken up just by interest payments on debts, broken down by income quintile. Across all income levels, the share of household disposable income devoted to interest payments on debt increased substantially since the start of 2020.\nAt the start of 2020, interest payments on debts—such as credit card, line of credit, or mortgage loans—took up an average of about 6 per cent of household disposable income. By the summer of 2024, that figure had nearly doubled to 11.6 per cent. The impact of debt grows more intense as household income gets lower—it’s especially punishing on the poorest quintile of households, who are paying nearly 20 per cent of their disposable income on interest payments alone.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe rapidly growing pain of debt is the intended consequence of the Bank of Canada’s ill-advised inflation busting strategy, cranking up interest rates to “cool” the economy. It has also made income inequality much worse. Most people are feeling the sting of rising interest rates. However, many high-income households have gained overall from increased investment returns on financial assets due to higher interest rates.\nIn accounting terms, most household expenses, on things like groceries or rent, are counted as consumption expenditures—spending that buys real goods and services.

The heart of the matter is that households are forced to spend a larger share of their disposable income on essentials compared to a few years ago.\nThe chart below depicts average household spending as a share of household disposable income. To account for income inequality, Statistics Canada has broken the data down by income quintile, meaning five equally sized groups of households from the lowest to highest incomes.\nSpending has been broken down into expenditures to meet basic needs (including housing, water, energy, food and non-alcoholic beverages) and all other goods and services. The share of income taken up by basic needs has grown for all households but those at the very top of the income hierarchy.\nFor households in the lowest fifth of incomes, spending on necessities rose by over 11.3 per cent, consuming nearly all of their disposable income—a deeply troubling indicator. Households in the second (5.8 per cent), third (2.2 per cent) and fourth (2.4 per cent) quintiles also experienced a rising share of income going toward necessities, with basic needs consuming between 55 and 39 per cent of their disposable income.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPeople in three of five income quintiles spent over 100 per cent of their disposable income in total, indicating debt-financed consumption. On the other hand, high income households were spending a bit less of their total disposable income than five years ago, meaning they have more discretionary income to spend, save, or invest at the end of the month.\nHow can we explain this trend? There are two factors working together to squeeze household finances for the majority of people. The first is the most obvious, because we notice it every time we shop for groceries—prices for staple goods have grown right alongside wages, even as overall inflation falls.

It is in effect, a gift from the Canadian government – and the tax paying public by extension – to corporations and the wealthiest people in society.\nIn Canada, about one in ten people will report capital gains in a given year. In 2021, nearly half of those in the top 1% of income takers reported capital gains, rising to nearly three-quarters of people in the very top 0.01% of the income distribution. Even when average people do post capital gains, they usually aren’t very high.\nTax filers in the top 1% of incomes had capital gains about 7.5 times higher than the bottom 99%, while those in the top 0.01% had gains over 57 times higher. For those at the top of the income ladder, average capital gains for those who had any were many times higher than average labour income for the vast majority of people.\nAs a result, capital gains are extremely concentrated in the hands of people with very high incomes and lots of concentrated wealth. According to economist Jim Stanford, the top 1.5% of tax filers booked 61% of all capital gains – he notes that there is no other form of income that is more concentrated at the top (p. 9).\nThe capital gains exclusion loophole is almost entirely a tax-free treat for the rich and corporations – perhaps that explains the ferocity of the counter reaction to such a modest tax hike."

In contrast, households in the fourth and highest quintiles enjoyed significant income growth, with average increases of $310 and $1,580 per month, respectively.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe cost of living has grown greatly, driven mostly by key products that meet basic needs, while at the same time, the amount of income available to buy those things is being diminished by debt. Household budgets are being squeezed on both ends, causing most people to go further into debt than they were a few years ago.\nBelow, we can see the change in net household savings since the start of 2020 by income group. Households in the lowest income quintile were now racking up nearly $3 thousand in debt each month, which was about 12 per cent more than in 2020 in real terms. Those in the second (88 per cent) and third (531 per cent) quintiles saw dramatic growth in their borrowing in just a few years.\nWhile most people are taking on more debt to stay afloat, those in the highest income quintile increased their monthly savings by over $1,000 or 23 per cent. Inequality is worsened as those on top gain even more discretionary income that can be freely spent or converted into investment assets."

    "text": "Data: Capital gains tax rates in Europe from 2011-2023\nIn general, international data or statistics on capital gains tax rates (CGT rate) are not easy to come by. This analysis relies on data published by the Tax Foundation on the top capital gains tax rates for individuals in over twenty European countries.\nNote, up until now we have been talking about the capital gains inclusion rate in Canada, how much is counted as taxable income, while this data deals with the actual top tax rates on capital gains in each country. With this data, we are comparing the actual top tax rates paid on capital gains by individuals, regardless of how that country taxes capital gains.\nThere are two periods covered, one from 2011-2014 and one from 2019-2023. I’m not aware of another data source to fill those years in, other than meticulous manual gathering from public records, which isn’t on the table right now.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPutting this dataset together requires some simplification for the purposes of comparison, since the way capital gains are treated can vary greatly across tax systems. Hover over countries marked by an asterisk to see notes on the data provided by the Tax Foundation.\nThis data set was combined with macro level economic data from the World Inequality Database and the OECD’s Productivity Statistics Database for comparison against capital gains tax rates."

    "text": "Capital gains tax rates not strongly linked to growth\nA striking episode of evidence free tax fear-mongering on behalf of capital came from the C.D. Howe Institute, which issued a report predicting a very small increase in capital gains taxes will inflict billions in economic damage, costing hundreds of thousands of jobs.\nCan a truly modest tax increase on capital bring about economic mass destruction according to so-called “financial theory?”\nWell, what can we observe from data when countries actually change their capital gains tax rates in the real world? According to the Tax Foundation’s data, 2011-2012 were banner years for capital gains tax reform and likely tax reform in general, as many European countries were pursuing somewhat more progressive tax policies in response to the revenue fallout of the Great Recession just a few years prior.\nSeveral countries, some of the largest economies in Europe at that, instituted a change in their top personal CGT rate from 2011 through to 2012. Below are the notable examples of countries that raised their CGT rate in 2012. That includes two that went from having no gains taxes to instituting a CGT rate of 25%, which is near the European average, Austria and Portugal. Italy went in the opposite direction, slashing it’s CGT rate from 45 down to 20%, but it did little to benefit their moribund economy.\nThe table below compares average GDP growth in the decade prior (2001-2011) to the CGT rate change to the tax-year and the next five years (2012-2017). There is not a clear relationship between changes in the CGT rate and economic growth that applies across all countries. Some raised the CGT rate and then outpaced their historical growth trend, while others raised their rates and then slightly under-performed over the next few years.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIt stands to reason that it is possible for changes in the CGT rate to have a macro level economic impact observable in growth rate changes. Yet as we can see plainly, even major changes in the CGT rate, including the shock of moving away from zero capital gains taxes, the impact on growth had to be minimal, with countries mostly staying in line with their long-term growth trajectories.\nNow, I don’t endorse using GDP or GDP growth as a measure of economic well-being, but in this context it yields zero evidence of the doom-and-gloom theorized by certain advocates of capital. Below, we look into the relationship between the CGT rate and some more meaningful variables of interest."

    "text": "Human need versus tax treats for the rich\nDespite rising total government spending, Canada’s vital public services and social programs face chronic under-funding from all levels of government. All across the country, public health care and education systems are crumbling, while provincial governments break new ground in privatization efforts.\nWhile the causes of these trends are no doubt complex, much of it comes down insufficient public spending in those areas. The flip side of inadequate spending is insufficient revenue. In recent decades, Canada’s federal and provincial governments, especially in Ontario, have issued tax cuts that have mostly benefited the wealthy or businesses, making Canada’s tax system more regressive, while reducing revenues available to fund public services and investment in public goods.\nAs we saw demonstrated in charts two and three, there is a connection between the progressiveness of a tax system, social and economic inequality and the spending priorities of governments. Each dollar lost into regressive tax loopholes for the rich represents a wasted opportunity for something better.\nPartial inclusion of capital gains is one of the most hefty tax expenditures by Canadian governments each year. From 2019 to 2024, the Canadian federal government spent over $168 billion to fund the capital gains exemption. That’s about $15 billion less than federal tax expenditures on the Canada Child Benefit in the same time span, a program that made a real impact on child poverty.\nThe chart below compares annual federal tax expenditures on the capital gains loophole versus the Canada Health Transfer (CHT) from 2019 to 2024. The CHT is the federal government’s main way of contributing to the funding of Canada’s health care systems, which exist under provincial jurisdiction.\nIn total, the Canadian federal government spent about $168 billion on the capital gains exclusion over five years, an average of about $26 billion per year. That means the federal government spent on average around 65% as much on making half of capital gains tax free – mostly for the wealthy and corporations – as they did on the main transfer that funds health care. In 2021, tax-free capital gains cost the public almost much (91%) as the entire CHT.\n\n\n \n\n  \n    \n      © Ryan Romard 2024  \n       \n    \n       \n    \n    \n      This website is built with [Bootswatch](https://bootswatch.com/) and [Quarto](https://quarto.org/)"
