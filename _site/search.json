I have worked with public sector education organizations, think tanks, and labour organizations to turn data and research into meaningful insights and policy tools for progress.\nWith expertise in sociology, political science, market research and data science, my work focuses on understanding and communicating the forces shaping our politics, economics, and society – as well as conducting more detailed and focused policy analysis or program evaluations to inform change.\nLately, I am researching and writing on the political economy of labour and unions in Canada. This site is a permanent home for my work that does not end up in other publications, as well as my data visualizations and interactive data products.

It will also provide a permanent home for some of my data storytelling and visualization work. I’m planning on adding some coding tutorials related to all of this in the future.\nI’m always looking for new opportunities to bring data to life through research, visualizations, or storytelling.
