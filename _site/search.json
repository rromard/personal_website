    "text": "Header on union members missing out (for now)\nHowever, those gains have not been evenly distributed. There is one group in particular that has – so far – been left out of the wage growth trend.\nThat would be union members, most of whom have endured stagnant or declining real wages. In the private sector, union members had paltry wage gains of just 30 cents (+0.81%) an hour from 2014 to 2024. Their public sector colleagues actually had real hourly wage losses of $1.26 (-2.5%) over that time.\nIt was another story for workers in non-unionized workplaces. Non-members in the private sector saw strong wage gains of $2.50 an hour (+13.9%). Non-unionized employees the public sector saw more modest gains of 40 cents an hour (+2.5%) but they are predominantly professionals and managers with already very high wages.\nWhy are union members, who have traditionally enjoyed higher wages, now losing out during a time of historic wage gains? To a large extent, it is down to timing and the method used to get a raise.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMuch of the private sector pay bump for non-unionized workers came from job-switching. In the past few years, many workers have either lost or left low-wage jobs in favor of better jobs with higher pay. It isn’t so simple to leave one unionized job for another to get a raise. Those types of jobs are more scarce and pay structures under collective agreements are often more strictly tied to seniority.\nFor most union members, the only option is to wait for an existing contract to end, then hope that the next one that includes a real raise. Most collective agreements in Canada are three to five years long. Workers with contracts that were signed close to the onset of the cost-of-living crisis in 2021-2022 have witnessed their real wages sputter while they wait for a new deal.\nIn the years to come, it is likely that private sector workers will regain the longstanding union wage premium, as pre-COL crisis contracts expire and new deals are signed. Seeing other private sector unions get results with large-scale, co-ordinated negotiation and strike action will hopefully be a wind in the sails of union militancy.\nIn the public sector, unionized workers also have to contend with bargaining interference and wage suppression by governments determined run roughshod over labour rights."

In the chart below, average real wages for private sector employees are shown for each quintile of hourly income over the last 10 years.\nWages have grown across the board, the most at the bottom of the wage distribution. In the lowest income quintile, average wages rose by nearly one-fifth (18.7%), which amounted to an increase of only $2.68 per hour. Workers in the next lowest quintile had healthy growth (+10.7%) as well, a pay raise of about $2.22 per hour.\nDespite strong wage growth, wages for many workers are still too low, especially given the baked-in price increases in staples like food, shelter, and energy. Surely, it is not bad vibes keeping the good news from the 40% of private sector workers that have hourly earnings just above or under the average national rental wage of $22.50.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIt has been a really great time to be one of the top income takers in the country.

    "text": "Private sector union wages are treading water\nFor union members, wage increases depend on collective bargaining – which ultimately depends on the right to strike. Contracts, which typically last three to five years in Canada, lock in wage rates for the duration of the agreement. Workers whose contracts were negotiated just before or during the early stages of the cost-of-living crisis in 2020-2021 have seen their real wages stagnate or decline as inflation eroded their purchasing power.\nA closer look at the data for private sector union members reveals the extent of the stagnation. The chart underneath shows average wages for private sector union members or those that are covered by a CA by each quintile of hourly earnings.\nWhile unionized workers in the lowest wage quintile saw some gains—an $1.75 increase (+11%) over the past decade—most others have seen little to no growth when accounting for inflation. Across most earnings levels, private sector union wages have barely moved, leaving workers no better off than a decade ago – and wondering when their pay will reflect the broader trend of wage growth.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Coming Battle for Fair Wages\nThe silver lining for private sector union members is that change may be on the horizon. As pre-cost-of-living crisis contracts expire and new agreements are negotiated, workers and their unions will likely push for significant raises to make up for lost ground. After a decade of treading water, the demand for better pay will be stronger than ever.\nCanadian union members can look to the example set by the United Auto Workers (UAW) in the United States. In a highly strategic and combative campaign, the UAW recently secured a 25% wage increase over four years—an impressive victory after decades of uphill struggle.\nIf Canadian unions take a similarly bold and strategic approach, the next wave of collective bargaining could bring long-overdue gains for unionized workers, restoring the wage premium they have historically enjoyed."

Since 2014, real wages have risen less than 1% in the private sector and actually dropped by 2.3 percent in the public sector. Over that time, the average wages of non-union workers grew to surpass unionized workers by about $1.43 per hour in the private sector. In the public sector, the gap was even higher at $3.05 hourly.\nDoes this mean that it is no longer worth it for workers to create and participate in unions? The short answer—absolutely not.

Unlike in the private sector, this has been a long-standing trend.\nOne reason for this is that higher union density rates in public sector workplaces mean membership more clearly separates average workers from highly paid professionals and managers (p. 19). Another reason is that unionized public sector workers have endured wage stagnation due to significant government attacks on their right to bargain and strike. Managers and many professionals, by contrast, face no such constraints.\nThe average union vs. non-union wage differential is largely driven by workers in highly paid professional occupations in the public sector—lawyers, engineers, and finance and health professionals, except nurses.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAs in the private sector, union members enjoy higher average wages throughout the bottom of the wage distribution. Union members had higher wages in 15 out of 23 (65%) occupations with lower-than-average wages for the public sector.

    "text": "For over a decade, real wage growth has been elusive for unionized workers. While non-union wages have climbed steadily, unionized workers have faced stagnation – and in some cases, decline. Yet despite what average wage data might suggest, union membership still secures higher pay for most workers, especially at the lower end of the wage distribution where workers need it the most.\nMy last analysis uncovered that real wages for union members have been stuck in limbo for at least a decade. Since 2014, real wages have risen less than 1% in the private sector and actually dropped by 2.3% in the public sector. Over that time, the average wages of non-union workers grew to surpass unionized workers by about $1.43 per hour in the private sector. In the public sector, the gap was even higher at $3.05 hourly.\nDoes this mean that it is no longer worth it for workers to form or join unions? Absolutely not. Union membership is virtually always in the short and long-term interests of workers – not just to get a bigger paycheck, but also a higher quality of life."

    "text": "Unions delivering for non-professional private sector workers\nEven if we focus solely on average hourly wages, leaving aside other important benefits like pension plans or healthcare coverage, most workers still get ahead by being union members. Average wage data conceals much complexity and difference under the surface. Now that non-union wages are higher “on average,” it is worth asking: whose wages are higher?\nThe charts in this post show the difference in average hourly wages in 2024 between union members and non-members across different sectors, occupations, and employment statuses, based on Labour Force Survey data. Since we are only looking at 2024 wages, the values are not inflation adjusted. The first chart below compares wages across all of the non-managerial job types based on the National Occupation Classification System.\nWhether or not unions lead to higher wages depends highly on the type of job. In the private sector, union members had higher average wages in the vast majority of non-professional occupations, as well as in a few professional categories like education or business jobs.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAs one goes down the wage ladder, the union advantage becomes more consistent. In occupations with below-average wages, union members consistently held higher wages, with the exception of (1) education and legal assistants, who had roughly equal wages and (2) sales and service occupations, where both wages and union density are very low.\nIn other words, unions are delivering a wage boost where it is needed the most – to workers in lower wage occupations.\nThis finding also implies that the union/non-union divergence in average wages is being driven largely by high-wage professional occupations like doctors or lawyers, where unionization rates tend to be very low due to the nature of these roles."

    "text": "Unions are busting inequality in the public sector\nA similar pattern is evident in the public sector, where average wages are about $3 higher per hour for non-union members. Unlike in the private sector, this is a long-standing trend.\nOne reason for this is that higher union density rates in public sector workplaces mean membership much more clearly separates average workers from highly paid professionals and managers (p. 19).\nAnother reason is that unionized public sector workers have endured wage stagnation due to significant government attacks on their right to bargain and strike. Managers and many professionals, by contrast, face no such constraints.\nThe average union vs. non-union wage differential is largely driven by workers in highly paid professional occupations in the public sector—lawyers, engineers, and finance and health professionals, except nurses.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAs in the private sector, union members enjoy higher average wages throughout the bottom of the wage distribution. Union members had higher wages in 15 out of 23 (65%) occupations with lower-than-average wages for the public sector.\nThis pattern of high union density that uplifts wages most at the low end—likely contributes to the inequality-reducing effects of public sector employment in Canada."

    "text": "Protecting the paychecks of precarious workers\nFinally, we can examine the effect of union membership with regard to employment status, which is one of the most important factors behind low pay. Workers outside the standard employment contract—such as involuntary part-timers, temporary workers, and multiple job holders—have much lower average wages.\nUnion membership largely protects against the corrosive effects of non-standard work arrangements on wages and working conditions. Workers in non-standard employment situations had average wages that were over $8 an hour higher (+32%) than their non-union counterparts."
