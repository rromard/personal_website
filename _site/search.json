    "text": "Header on union members missing out (for now)\nHowever, those gains have not been evenly distributed. There is one group in particular that has – so far – been left out of the wage growth trend.\nThat would be union members, most of whom have endured stagnant or declining real wages. In the private sector, union members had paltry wage gains of just 30 cents (+0.81%) an hour from 2014 to 2024. Their public sector colleagues actually had real hourly wage losses of $1.26 (-2.5%) over that time.\nIt was another story for workers in non-unionized workplaces. Non-members in the private sector saw strong wage gains of $2.50 an hour (+13.9%). Non-unionized employees the public sector saw more modest gains of 40 cents an hour (+2.5%) but they are predominantly professionals and managers with already very high wages.\nWhy are union members, who have traditionally enjoyed higher wages, now losing out during a time of historic wage gains? To a large extent, it is down to timing and the method used to get a raise.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMuch of the private sector pay bump for non-unionized workers came from job-switching. In the past few years, many workers have either lost or left low-wage jobs in favor of better jobs with higher pay. It isn’t so simple to leave one unionized job for another to get a raise. Those types of jobs are more scarce and pay structures under collective agreements are often more strictly tied to seniority.\nFor most union members, the only option is to wait for an existing contract to end, then hope that the next one that includes a real raise. Most collective agreements in Canada are three to five years long. Workers with contracts that were signed close to the onset of the cost-of-living crisis in 2021-2022 have witnessed their real wages sputter while they wait for a new deal.\nIn the years to come, it is likely that private sector workers will regain the longstanding union wage premium, as pre-COL crisis contracts expire and new deals are signed. Seeing other private sector unions get results with large-scale, co-ordinated negotiation and strike action will hopefully be a wind in the sails of union militancy.\nIn the public sector, unionized workers also have to contend with bargaining interference and wage suppression by governments determined run roughshod over labour rights."

In the chart below, average real wages for private sector employees are shown for each quintile of hourly income over the last 10 years.\nWages have grown across the board, the most at the bottom of the wage distribution. In the lowest income quintile, average wages rose by nearly one-fifth (18.7%), which amounted to an increase of only $2.68 per hour. Workers in the next lowest quintile had healthy growth (+10.7%) as well, a pay raise of about $2.22 per hour.\nDespite strong wage growth, wages for many workers are still too low, especially given the baked-in price increases in staples like food, shelter, and energy. Surely, it is not bad vibes keeping the good news from the 40% of private sector workers that have hourly earnings just above or under the average national rental wage of $22.50.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIt has been a really great time to be one of the top income takers in the country. Those in the top quintile saw their wages grow by $4.35 an hour (+8.7%) landing just shy of $68 an hour, nearly four times what those at the bottom were making."

    "text": "Private sector union wages are treading water\nFor union members, wage increases depend on collective bargaining – which ultimately depends on the right to strike. Contracts, which typically last three to five years in Canada, lock in wage rates for the duration of the agreement. Workers whose contracts were negotiated just before or during the early stages of the cost-of-living crisis in 2020-2021 have seen their real wages stagnate or decline as inflation eroded their purchasing power.\nA closer look at the data for private sector union members reveals the extent of the stagnation. The chart underneath shows average wages for private sector union members or those that are covered by a CA by each quintile of hourly earnings.\nWhile unionized workers in the lowest wage quintile saw some gains—an $1.75 increase (+11%) over the past decade—most others have seen little to no growth when accounting for inflation. Across most earnings levels, private sector union wages have barely moved, leaving workers no better off than a decade ago – and wondering when their pay will reflect the broader trend of wage growth.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Coming Battle for Fair Wages\nThe silver lining for private sector union members is that change may be on the horizon. As pre-cost-of-living crisis contracts expire and new agreements are negotiated, workers and their unions will likely push for significant raises to make up for lost ground. After a decade of treading water, the demand for better pay will be stronger than ever.\nCanadian union members can look to the example set by the United Auto Workers (UAW) in the United States. In a highly strategic and combative campaign, the UAW recently secured a 25% wage increase over four years—an impressive victory after decades of uphill struggle.\nIf Canadian unions take a similarly bold and strategic approach, the next wave of collective bargaining could bring long-overdue gains for unionized workers, restoring the wage premium they have historically enjoyed."

    "text": "Union members, nearly a third of workers, are being left behind\nWhile many workers are seeing their wages grow, union members are notably missing out. Most have experienced stagnant or even declining real wages. The chart below shows average wages for non-union workers compared to those who are either union members or are covered by a collective agreement.\nIn the private sector, unionized workers saw their hourly wages increase by a meager 30 cents (+0.9%) from 2014 to 2024. Public sector union members fared even worse, with real hourly wages dropping by 94 cents an hour (-2.3%) over the same period.\nBy contrast, non-unionized workers have seen substantial wage growth. In the private sector, non-union employees enjoyed an impressive $4.15 (+14.2%) increase in hourly pay. Non-union public sector workers, primarily professionals and managers that are already highly paid, experienced more modest gains of $1.12 (+2.7%).\nHistorically, private sector union members earned higher average wages than their non-unionized peers. But since the onset of the cost-of-living crisis in 2021-22, that advantage has eroded. Today, average wages for non-unionized workers exceed those of unionized workers by about 40 cents per hour.\nIn 2024, there were over 3.3 million union members in the public sector and another 2 million in the private sector – that’s about three in ten paid employees in the country who have largely been left behind as wages rise.\nWhy are union members, long known for securing better wages, falling behind during this period of historic wage growth?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOne major factor is job-switching. Much of the wage growth among non-unionized private sector workers has been driven by employees leaving low-paying jobs for higher-paying opportunities. Given the higher than usual labour demand as the economy re-opened – pandemic be damned – from late 2021 to 2023, employers also had to offer higher wages to attract new hires, especially in very low-wage, front-line industries. This path to higher earnings isn’t as available to union members.\nUnionized jobs, particularly in the private sector, are relatively scarce. Opportunities to move from one unionized position to another are limited. Even when such moves are possible, the wage structures in unionized workplaces are typically tied to seniority, making it difficult to achieve immediate pay increases by switching jobs."

    "text": "Private sector union wages are treading water\nFor union members, wage increases depend on collective bargaining – which ultimately depends on the right to strike. Contracts, which typically last three to five years in Canada, lock in wage rates for the duration of the agreement. Workers whose contracts were negotiated just before or during the early stages of the cost-of-living crisis in 2020-2021 have seen their real wages stagnate or decline as inflation eroded their purchasing power.\nA closer look at the data for private sector union members reveals the extent of the stagnation. The chart underneath shows average wages for private sector union members or those that are covered by a CA by each quintile of hourly earnings.\nWhile unionized workers in the lowest wage quintile saw some gains—an $1.75 increase (+11%) over the past decade—most others have seen little to no growth when accounting for inflation. Across most earnings levels, private sector union wages have barely moved, leaving most workers no better off than a decade ago – and wondering when their pay will reflect the broader trend of wage growth.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Coming Battle for Fair Wages\nThe silver lining for private sector union members is that change may be on the horizon. As pre-cost-of-living crisis contracts expire and new agreements are negotiated, workers and their unions will likely push for significant raises to make up for lost ground. After a decade of treading water, the demand for major raises that restore lost purchasing power will be stronger than ever.\nCanadian union members are already looking to the example set by the United Auto Workers (UAW) in the United States. In a highly strategic and combative campaign, the UAW recently secured a 25% wage increase over four years—an impressive victory after decades of uphill struggle.\nIf Canadian unions take a similarly bold and strategic approach, the next wave of collective bargaining could bring long-overdue gains for unionized workers, restoring the wage premium they have historically enjoyed."
